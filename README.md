# vita-folder-viewer
A very simple Godot application used to more easily browse applications installed on the Vita.

Set the path to the root of your Vita, press 'Search' and then expand the sub-folders to view the application names in a human readable format.

Double click any entry to open that application's containing folder. The text input on the top is used for filtering.
